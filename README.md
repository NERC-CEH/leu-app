## Development

You can run the application locally by running these steps on a **Node 8** environment.
This will build the codebase and start the local web server. First, you have to clone the repository, navigate to the codebase folder on your machine and then execute these commands:

```
npm install         # installs all the dependencies
npm run build:dev   # builds the codebase
npm run start-dev   # serves as a web app
```

The application should now be available by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

To build a production-ready app run `npm run build` - see `package.json` for more commands.
